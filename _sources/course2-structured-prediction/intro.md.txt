# Introduction

**Intended audience**: Software engineers or ML engineers, who are familiar with Python and have some exposure to computer vision. If not, do not worry. A good place to start is [this video](https://course18.fast.ai/lessons/lesson1.html) and [this tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html). Familiarity with Python and Jupyter Notebook ([quickstart](https://www.theclickreader.com/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/)) is needed.

**What you will learn**: through a tour of structured prediction tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, pose estimation and document understanding, you will learn common neural network architecture choices to tackle the wide range of problems that arise in different real world applications.

At the end of the course. we hope you feel prepared to work on a practical project for a wide range of structured prediction problems. 

**How to use the course materials and organize your work**

You can run the code in each course project using Colab notebooks, whenever you see a rocket-shaped launch button in the top right corner of the page. This is a quick way to get started, without needing to install CUDA drivers and other dependencies. Alternatively, you can create a repo and accumulate source code as you evolve it in the course. Either way works.

The course is orgaized as the following course projects:

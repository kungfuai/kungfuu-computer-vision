    "Iteration speed is one of the most important factors in the success of experimentation and model training. This is because machine learning is very much an empirical science. Serious researchers and practitioners tend not to make bold claims that certain methods work for all problems. Instead, recipes need to be found for a particular domain, and even a particular dataset.\n",

# KUNGFU.U Computer Vision Courses

This repo holds publicly accessible materials for KUNGFU.U (KUNGFU University) Computer Vision Courses.

- The courses are designed to be used by machine learning engineers, data scientists and software engineers who want to learn more about AI and computer vision.
- The courses are project based, with coding practices that walk through the practical steps of building computer vision models and evolving training recipes.
- They are not a thorough introduction to fundamental techniques in computer vision, for which there are many excellent public courses available (such as [this course on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/convolutional-neural-networks/computer-vision-Ob1nR) and [this course on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf0WB91t8Ky6AuYcQV0CcLw)).

## Quickstart

Install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

To build a course, run `bin/build.sh <course-name>`. If you are inside the directory of a coruse, run `../bin/build.sh .`.
